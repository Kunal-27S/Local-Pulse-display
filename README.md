# Local Pulse üåç

## Inspiration
Local Pulse was born from the observation that while there are numerous social media platforms, none truly leverage location-based content sorting. Also, the innovative concept of searching through the app's own database to generate relevant information in the AI Chatbot sparked the creation of this unique platform
